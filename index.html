        <h1>Why Humanitarian Aid is Needed for Gaza</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Gaza, a densely populated region, has been facing numerous humanitarian challenges that require urgent attention and aid. Here are some key facts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gaza has limited access to clean water, leading to water scarcity and a health crisis.</li>
            <li>The healthcare system in Gaza is overwhelmed, lacking essential medical supplies and resources.</li>
            <li>Food insecurity is prevalent, with many families struggling to access nutritious meals.</li>
            <li>The unemployment rate in Gaza is high, leading to poverty and economic instability.</li>
            <li>Gaza's infrastructure has been severely damaged, hindering daily life and recovery efforts.</li>
            <li>The blockade on Gaza has restricted the movement of goods and people, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Humanitarian aid is crucial to alleviate the suffering of the children in Gaza and support their basic needs for survival and recovery.</p>
